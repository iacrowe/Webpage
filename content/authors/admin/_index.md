I am Associate Professor at the University of Leeds and Honorary Consultant Hepatologist at the Leeds Liver Unit.  My group focuses on patient relevant aspects of clinical hepatology, particularly diagnosis and the impacts of treatment on outcomes, using wide range of methods from analytical epidemiology to large-scale clinical trials.

I am currently Chair of the British Association for the Study of the Liver Research Committee and I lead the Monitoring Group for the National Liver Transplant Offering System.
